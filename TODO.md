Build the whole app, hahaha!

Plan:
Have a sidebar similiar to the one on VSCode broken down into sections.

Store everything in a DB, maybe mongo?

Basically two types of Objects:
Topic:
    Has a title, and a body
Section:
    Can contain another section or a topic



allow people to rename, move sections, and of course edit.
